## Routes

- Done/Tested
### GET `/route/routes`
Retrieve all bus routes.
e.g Belfast -> Lisburn

**Response – 200**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string"
  }
]
```

**Notes**
- `id` is the route identifier (string / UUID depending on backend)

---


### GET `/route/routes/{route_id}/stops`
Fetch all stops along a route in sequence order.

**Path Parameters**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
| route_id | string | yes | Route identifier |

**Response – 200**

    "sequence": 1
  }
]
```

**Response – 404**

## Journeys

### POST `/journeys/start`
Start a new journey.

**Response – 200**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "predicted_status": "string",
    "predicted_arrival": "ISO-8601 datetime"
  }
]
```

**Notes**
- Returns an array for consistency with backend implementation
- `predicted_arrival` is server-calculated

---

### POST `/journeys/{journey_id}/event`
Add an event to an active journey (e.g. arrived, delayed, stop reached).

**Path Parameters**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |

}
```

**Response – 200**
```json
{
  "journey_id": "uuid",
  "status": "string"
}
```

**Notes**
- `type` is an enum controlled by backend
- Status is recalculated after each event

---

## Enums

### JourneyEventType
```ts
ARRIVED
DELAYED
STOP_REACHED
```

---

## General Conventions
- All timestamps are **ISO-8601**
- UUIDs are returned as strings
- Errors follow FastAPI default format
